Algorithm, parallelization method: K-means clustering
To reproduce the results just run all cells from the notebook, at the results section you will see difference between paralleled algo and non-paralleled one, data is produced automatically.
Parallel part: computation of distances between points and centroids, partial sums and counts for updating centroids.
Figure with speedup calculations is available at the results section of the notebook.
